Overview:
This repository contains a hypothetical enterprise risk management case study focused on a cloud-native Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform, using Okta Inc. as a representative example. The case study applies structured Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and Information Security Risk Management (ISRM) principles to analyse security, operational, legal, and third-party risks associated with enterprise IAM services.
The analysis is based exclusively on publicly available information and is intended for professional portfolio and educational purposes.
________________________________________
Scope and Objectives:
The objectives of this case study are to:
•	Assess information security risks associated with cloud-based IAM platforms
•	Apply structured risk management methodologies aligned with ISO/IEC 27005 principles
•	Identify key assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and stakeholders
•	Evaluate risk likelihood and impact using qualitative risk criteria
•	Propose high-level risk treatment and mitigation strategies
The assessment focuses on enterprise IAM capabilities including authentication, authorisation, session management, API integration, and third-party dependencies.

•	Context establishment and scope definition
•	Stakeholder and asset identification
•	Threat and vulnerability analysis
•	Risk evaluation using likelihood and consequence matrices
•	Consideration of governance, compliance, and operational factors
•	Use of publicly reported incidents and industry research
